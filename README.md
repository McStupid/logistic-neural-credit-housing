This repository contains the code and results for In-Class Activity 1 of the Soft Computing (7168/7197) course, Semester 2 â€“ 2025.

The task involves building and comparing machine learning models for:

    Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression and Neural Networks.

    California House Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Neural Networks.

Multiple feature combinations were tested for both tasks to evaluate model performance, and training accuracy or mean squared error (MSE) was recorded.
